# This is a test.

This repository needs some fixing:

- Scrolling performance is laggy
- There are layout bugs in the detail view on rotation
- It crashes when going into and out of detail views quickly

Fix as many issues as you can, **without changing the appearance or behavior of the app's UI**, and if you have extra time, refactor the code to make it as clean as you can within the allotted time.
